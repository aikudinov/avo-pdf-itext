# avo-pdf-itext
Blueprism VBO for working with PDF using the iText library. 

Import the xml in Blueprism to use the VBO.
You can also read the code directly from the xml file.

Need iText library files. 
Default placement of the dll files is in the Blue Prism Automate folder. If you want to store the files somewhere else, you need to update the references in the VBO.
iText library files can be found by following instructions on https://itextpdf.com or on iText github page: https://github.com/itext/itext7-dotnet
